Terminal-Based Async Chatroom

Welcome to the Terminal-Based Async Chatroom project! This application allows multiple users to create and join chat rooms and chat in real-time directly from their terminals.

ðŸš€ Key Features

Asynchronous Networking: Built with asyncio for scalable real-time interactions.

Multi-Room Support: Users can create, join, and leave multiple chat rooms.

User Management: Username selection on connection and user listing within rooms.

Real-Time Messaging: Messages are broadcasted live to all room members.

Safe Room Management: Room operations use asyncio.Lock to avoid race conditions.

Graceful Exit: Users can leave rooms cleanly with exit.

Server Logging: New connections and disconnections are logged to the server console.

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

File

Description

server.py

The asynchronous TCP server that manages incoming clients.

client.py

The terminal-based client that connects to the server.

rooms.py

Room and RoomManager classes for managing chat rooms (with asyncio.Lock).

utils.py

Utility functions like trimming newlines.

.venv/

Virtual environment folder created with uv for project isolation.

.python-version

Specifies the Python version to use (managed by pyenv).

pyproject.toml

Project metadata and dependency management file (created by uv).

__pycache__/

Auto-generated bytecode cache for faster module loading (created by Python).

ðŸ“š How to Run This Project

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/Djean3/chatroom.git
cd chatroom

2. Set up the Virtual Environment

uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

(If you don't have uv, you can use python3 -m venv .venv.)

3. Open Three Terminal Windows

Terminal 1: Run the server

Terminal 2: Run the first client

Terminal 3: Run the second client (and more if needed)

4. Run the Server (Terminal 1)

python server.py

5. Run the Clients (Terminal 2 and 3)

python client.py

ðŸ“ƒ About Supporting Files

.venv/: The isolated Python virtual environment (best practice for Python projects).

pyproject.toml: Created automatically by uv; stores project dependencies and Python compatibility.

.python-version: Specifies the exact Python version (3.11.7) to ensure consistent environments (useful for pyenv).

__pycache__/: Standard Python cache folder; improves runtime performance.

Terminal-Based Async Chatroom
Welcome to the Terminal-Based Async Chatroom project!
This application allows multiple users to create and join chat rooms and chat in real-time directly from their terminals.

Key Features
Asynchronous Networking: Built with asyncio for scalable, real-time interactions.

Multi-Room Support: Users can create, join, and leave multiple chat rooms.

User Management: Username selection on connection and user listing within rooms.

Real-Time Messaging: Messages are broadcasted live to all room members.

Safe Room Management: Room operations use asyncio.Lock to avoid race conditions.

Graceful Exit: Users can leave rooms cleanly with the exit command.

Server Logging: New connections and disconnections are logged to the server console.

Project Structure

File	Description
server.py	Asynchronous TCP server that manages incoming clients.
client.py	Terminal-based client that connects to the server.
rooms.py	Room and RoomManager classes for managing chat rooms (with asyncio.Lock).
utils.py	Utility functions like trimming newlines.
.venv/	Virtual environment folder created with uv for project isolation.
.python-version	Specifies the Python version (managed by pyenv).
pyproject.toml	Project metadata and dependency management file (created by uv).
__pycache__/	Auto-generated bytecode cache for faster module loading (created by Python).
How to Run This Project
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Djean3/chatroom.git
cd chatroom
2. Set Up the Virtual Environment
bash
Copy
Edit
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
If you don't have uv, you can use:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
3. Open Three Terminal Windows
Terminal 1: Run the server

Terminal 2: Run the first client

Terminal 3: Run the second client (and more if needed)

4. Run the Server (Terminal 1)
bash
Copy
Edit
python server.py
5. Run the Clients (Terminal 2 and 3)
bash
Copy
Edit
python client.py

About Supporting Files
.venv/ — Isolated Python virtual environment (best practice for project isolation).

pyproject.toml — Automatically created by uv; stores project dependencies and compatibility settings.

.python-version — Defines the exact Python version (3.11.7) to ensure consistent environments (useful for pyenv users).

__pycache__/ — Auto-generated cache folder for faster module loading.

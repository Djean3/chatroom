Welcome to the **Terminal-Based Async Chatroom** project! This application provides a real-time, multi-user chat experience directly within your terminal, leveraging asynchronous networking for efficient and scalable communication.

##  Key Features

* **Asynchronous Networking:** Built using `asyncio` to handle multiple concurrent connections and real-time interactions efficiently.
* **Multi-Room Support:** Users can create, join, and leave multiple chat rooms to participate in different conversations.
* **User Management:** Upon connecting, users can choose a unique username, and the application keeps track of users within each room.
* **Real-Time Messaging:** Messages sent by users are instantly broadcasted to all other members within the same room.
* **Safe Room Management:** Utilizes `asyncio.Lock` to ensure thread-safe operations when managing chat rooms, preventing race conditions.
* **Graceful Exit:** Users can cleanly disconnect from rooms and the application using simple commands.
* **Server Logging:** The server console logs new connections and disconnections for monitoring and debugging purposes.

##  Project Structure
```bash
chatroom/
â”œâ”€â”€ server.py         # Asynchronous TCP server that manages incoming clients
â”œâ”€â”€ client.py         # Terminal-based client that connects to the server
â”œâ”€â”€ rooms.py          # Room and RoomManager classes for managing chat rooms (with asyncio.Lock)
â”œâ”€â”€ utils.py          # Utility functions like trimming newlines
â”œâ”€â”€ .venv/            # Virtual environment folder created with uv for project isolation
â”œâ”€â”€ .python-version   # Specifies the Python version (managed by pyenv)
â””â”€â”€ pyproject.toml    # Project metadata and dependency management file (created by uv)
â””â”€â”€ pycache/          # Auto-generated bytecode cache for faster module loading (created by Python)
```

## ðŸš€ How to Run This Project

Follow these steps to get the chatroom application up and running on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project. Then, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Djean3/chatroom.git
cd chatroom
```

### 2. Set Up the Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies:

Create virtual environment:
```bash
uv venv .venv
```
Activate virtual enviornment:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

After activating your virtual environment, run the following command to install all required libraries:
```bash
uv pip sync pyproject.toml
source
```

### 3. Open Multiple Terminal Windows

You will need at least three terminal windows to run the server and a couple of clients.

* Terminal 1: Will be used to run the server.
* Terminal 2: Will be used to run the first client.
* Terminal 3: Will be used to run the second client (you can open more for additional users).

### 4. Run the Server (Terminal 1)
In the first terminal window, navigate to the project directory (chatroom) and run the server using the following command:

```bash
python server.py
```

### 5. Run the Clients (Terminal 2 and 3)
In the second and third terminal windows (and any additional windows for more clients), navigate to the project directory (chatroom) and run the client using the following command:
```bash
python client.py
```

### Inside the Chatroom
Once you have connected a client, you will see a menu with the following options:
```bash
1. Create Room
2. Join Room
3. List Available Rooms
4. Exit
```
Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the chatroom.

### Special Commands Inside a Room

While you are inside a chat room, you can use the following special commands:
```
/who: Lists all the users currently in the same room as you.
exit: Leaves the current chat room and returns you to the main menu.
```
### About Supporting Files

Here's a breakdown of the supporting files in this project:

* `.venv/`: This directory contains the isolated Python virtual environment.  It's a best practice to keep project dependencies separate to avoid conflicts with other Python projects.
* `pyproject.toml`: This file is automatically created by `uv` (or can be created manually for other package managers). It stores project metadata and dependency information, contributing to reproducible builds.
* `.python-version`: This file specifies the exact Python version (in this case, 3.11.7) that the project is intended to use. This is particularly helpful for users who manage multiple Python versions using tools like `pyenv`, ensuring a consistent development environment.
* `__pycache__/`: This directory is automatically generated by Python and contains the bytecode cache of imported modules. It helps speed up module loading in subsequent runs.

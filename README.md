Terminal-Based Async Chatroom
Welcome to the Terminal-Based Async Chatroom project!
This application allows multiple users to create and join chat rooms and chat in real-time directly from their terminals.

Welcome to the **Terminal-Based Async Chatroom** project! This application provides a real-time, multi-user chat experience directly within your terminal, leveraging asynchronous networking for efficient and scalable communication.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Asynchronous Networking:** Built using `asyncio` to handle multiple concurrent connections and real-time interactions efficiently.
* **Multi-Room Support:** Users can create, join, and leave multiple chat rooms to participate in different conversations.
* **User Management:** Upon connecting, users can choose a unique username, and the application keeps track of users within each room.
* **Real-Time Messaging:** Messages sent by users are instantly broadcasted to all other members within the same room.
* **Safe Room Management:** Utilizes `asyncio.Lock` to ensure thread-safe operations when managing chat rooms, preventing race conditions.
* **Graceful Exit:** Users can cleanly disconnect from rooms and the application using simple commands.
* **Server Logging:** The server console logs new connections and disconnections for monitoring and debugging purposes.

## üöÄ How to Run This Project

Follow these steps to get the chatroom application up and running on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project. Then, run the following command:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Djean3/chatroom.git](https://github.com/Djean3/chatroom.git)
cd chatroom
''':

### 1. Clone the Repository

### 1. Clone the Repository
### 1. Clone the Repository
### 2. Set Up the Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies. You can use uv (if you have it installed) or venv:

Using uv (recommended if installed):

uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

3. Open Multiple Terminal Windows
You will need at least three terminal windows to run the server and a couple of clients.

Terminal 1: Will be used to run the server.
Terminal 2: Will be used to run the first client.
Terminal 3: Will be used to run the second client (you can open more for additional users).

4. Run the Server (Terminal 1)
In the first terminal window, navigate to the project directory (chatroom) and run the server using the following command

python server.py

5. Run the Clients (Terminal 2 and 3)
In the second and third terminal windows (and any additional windows for more clients), navigate to the project directory (chatroom) and run the client using the following command:
python client.py


üí¨ Inside the Chatroom
Once you have connected a client, you will see a menu with the following options:

1. Create Room
2. Join Room
3. List Available Rooms
4. Exit

Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the chatroom.

Special Commands Inside a Room
While you are inside a chat room, you can use the following special commands:

/who: Lists all the users currently in the same room as you.
exit: Leaves the current chat room and returns you to the main menu.
‚ÑπÔ∏è About Supporting Files
.venv/: This directory contains the isolated Python virtual environment. It's best practice to keep project dependencies separate to avoid conflicts with other Python projects.
pyproject.toml: This file is automatically created by uv (or can be created manually for other package managers). It stores project metadata and dependency information, contributing to reproducible builds.
.python-version: This file specifies the exact Python version (in this case, 3.11.7) that the project is intended to use. This is particularly helpful for users who manage multiple Python versions using tools like pyenv, ensuring a consistent development environment.
__pycache__/: This directory is automatically generated by Python and contains the bytecode cache of imported modules. It helps speed up module loading in subsequent runs.


Key Features
Asynchronous Networking: Built with asyncio for scalable, real-time interactions.

Multi-Room Support: Users can create, join, and leave multiple chat rooms.

User Management: Username selection on connection and user listing within rooms.

Real-Time Messaging: Messages are broadcasted live to all room members.

Safe Room Management: Room operations use asyncio.Lock to avoid race conditions.

Graceful Exit: Users can leave rooms cleanly with the exit command.

Server Logging: New connections and disconnections are logged to the server console.

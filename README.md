Welcome to the **Terminal-Based Async Chatroom** project! This application provides a real-time, multi-user chat experience directly within your terminal, leveraging asynchronous networking for efficient and scalable communication.

## âœ¨ Key Features

* **Asynchronous Networking:** Built using `asyncio` to handle multiple concurrent connections and real-time interactions efficiently.
* **Multi-Room Support:** Users can create, join, and leave multiple chat rooms to participate in different conversations.
* **User Management:** Upon connecting, users can choose a unique username, and the application keeps track of users within each room.
* **Real-Time Messaging:** Messages sent by users are instantly broadcasted to all other members within the same room.
* **Safe Room Management:** Utilizes `asyncio.Lock` to ensure thread-safe operations when managing chat rooms, preventing race conditions.
* **Graceful Exit:** Users can cleanly disconnect from rooms and the application using simple commands.
* **Server Logging:** The server console logs new connections and disconnections for monitoring and debugging purposes.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure


Key Features
Asynchronous Networking: Built with asyncio for scalable, real-time interactions.

Multi-Room Support: Users can create, join, and leave multiple chat rooms.

User Management: Username selection on connection and user listing within rooms.

Real-Time Messaging: Messages are broadcasted live to all room members.

Safe Room Management: Room operations use asyncio.Lock to avoid race conditions.

Graceful Exit: Users can leave rooms cleanly with the exit command.

Server Logging: New connections and disconnections are logged to the server console.

Project Structure

File	Description
server.py	Asynchronous TCP server that manages incoming clients.
client.py	Terminal-based client that connects to the server.
rooms.py	Room and RoomManager classes for managing chat rooms (with asyncio.Lock).
utils.py	Utility functions like trimming newlines.
.venv/	Virtual environment folder created with uv for project isolation.
.python-version	Specifies the Python version (managed by pyenv).
pyproject.toml	Project metadata and dependency management file (created by uv).
__pycache__/	Auto-generated bytecode cache for faster module loading (created by Python).
How to Run This Project
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Djean3/chatroom.git
cd chatroom
2. Set Up the Virtual Environment
bash
Copy
Edit
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
If you don't have uv, you can use:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
3. Open Three Terminal Windows
Terminal 1: Run the server

Terminal 2: Run the first client

Terminal 3: Run the second client (and more if needed)

4. Run the Server (Terminal 1)
bash
Copy
Edit
python server.py
5. Run the Clients (Terminal 2 and 3)
bash
Copy
Edit
python client.py
Inside the Chatroom
Create a Room: Option 1 from the menu

Join a Room: Option 2 from the menu

List Available Rooms: Option 3

Exit: Option 4

Special Commands Inside a Room
/who â€” Lists all users in the current room.

exit â€” Leaves the current room.

About Supporting Files
.venv/ â€” Isolated Python virtual environment (best practice for project isolation).

pyproject.toml â€” Automatically created by uv; stores project dependencies and compatibility settings.

.python-version â€” Defines the exact Python version (3.11.7) to ensure consistent environments (useful for pyenv users).

__pycache__/ â€” Auto-generated cache folder for faster module loading.
